    <h1>Uroš Blagojević</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Uroš Blagojević (b. 2001). 
      I am a third-year graphic design student, living and creating in Belgrade. I view design not only as a visual practice but also as a way of exploring the world around me. I am most inspired by illustration and publication design, as they allow me to combine artistic expression with narrative and ideas. I am particularly drawn to themes of psychology and philosophy, as I believe design should always convey a deeper message and provoke thought in the viewer. In my work, I strive for a balance between aesthetics and functionality, aiming to create visual solutions that are clear, striking, and meaningfully connected to the context in which they are created. I often find inspiration in everyday life, art, film, and literature, which helps me develop my own visual language. I am open to collaboration, new ideas, and projects through which I can learn, explore, and contribute.
